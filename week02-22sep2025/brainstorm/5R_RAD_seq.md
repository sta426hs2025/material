Technology: RAD-seq

RAD-seq (Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing) is a method used to identify polymorphic variants located near restriction enzyme cut sites. The process begins by digesting genomic DNA with specific restriction enzymes. Barcoded adapters are then ligated to the resulting fragments, after which the DNA is sheared, amplified, and sequenced. Since only a subset of the genome adjacent to restriction sites is sequenced, the approach is both time- and cost-efficient. RAD-seq is particularly valuable for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and genotyping. Moreover, because it does not rely on a reference genome, it is especially useful in population genetic studies of species with little or no existing sequence data.

A popular application for RAD sequencing is population genomics. It allows for an efficient analysis of the evolutionary relationship between different species and it surpasses other methods by being able to identify, verify and score markers simultaneously.
Some key statistical methods include outlier detection (e.g., BayeScan, PCAdapt) to find loci under selection, environmental association analyses (e.g., LFMM) to link genetic variation with ecological factors, and clustering approaches (e.g., ADMIXTURE, Structure) to infer population structure and admixture.
