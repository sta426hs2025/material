## Summary

**How it works:** DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils (read as thymine), while methylated cytosines remain unchanged. Sequencing then reveals which cytosines were methylated.

**What it does:** Provides a map of DNA methylation at single-base resolution across the genome.

**Used for:** Studying epigenetic regulation, identifying abnormal methylation in diseases (like cancer), and analyzing developmental or tissue-specific methylation patterns.

**In short:** Methyl-seq tells you where DNA is methylated and how that affects gene regulation.


- **Technology:** bisulfite conversion
- **Application:** DNA methylation mapping (studying epigenetic regulation)
- **Statistial Methodology:** Binomial models (fisher exact test) 


Prompts (ChatGPT):  

> Can you tell me how methyl seq works, what it does and what it is used for (keep it brief)

> make the link (technology -> application -> statistcs)

> what statistical method is used under the hood for analysing
