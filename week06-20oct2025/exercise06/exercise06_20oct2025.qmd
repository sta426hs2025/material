## Comparison of Expression Estimates

The data set consists for 3 Normal samples and 3 Treated samples with 2.5 Mio reads each. The reads are simulated to come from genes on the human chromosome 1.

The expression values from featureCounts were created with:
We use the library `Rsubread` to generate the counts
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Rsubread)
countResult1 = featureCounts(..., strandSpecific=0,
                                 GTF.featureType="exon", GTF.attrType="gene_id", useMetaFeatures=TRUE,
                                 allowMultiOverlap=TRUE, countMultiMappingReads=FALSE)
save(countResult1, file="countResult1.RData")
countResult2 = featureCounts(..., strandSpecific=0,
                                 GTF.featureType="exon", GTF.attrType="gene_id", useMetaFeatures=TRUE,
                                 allowMultiOverlap=TRUE, countMultiMappingReads=TRUE, fraction=TRUE)
save(countResult2, file="countResult2.RData")
```

The RSEM data were generated with
```{sh, eval=FALSE}
rsem-calculate-expression .... --calc-pme --calc-ci --strandedness none ...
```

## Exercises

1. Depending on the featureCount mode, how many alignments are ignored during counting?  
2. Compare the counts from featureCounts with the genelevel counts from RSEM. Compute the number of genes where the expression value differs by more than 10%? 
3. How does the sum of the counts in RSEM compare to the number of the aligned reads?  
4. Compute pair-wise correlation of the samples based on the isoform counts and gene level counts
